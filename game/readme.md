## A Small 2D Platformer Built with Phaser

This project was created between March 11th and March 16th, 2017.

I would say I spent approximately **4 hours** doing initial research into Phaser, and a couple of other Javascript libraries for game development. I settled on Phaser because it has some built-in support for reading in tilemaps created in [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) which is a great tool for creating 2D tilemaps I wished to better learn and acquaint myself with.

Once I settled on Phaser, I spent about **4 hours** in search of some learning materials to find a good grasp on Phaser. While searching, I found [Matt McFarland's Phaser Menu System](https://github.com/MattMcFarland/phaser-menu-system) on GitHub, and began reading his documentation and pouring through the code. By going through his tutorials on his github, I created a slightly simplified version of this system as a shell for my game, and I began work on the game in earnest.

On Sunday, I spent about **2 hours** working on my initial concept. I tossed around several ideas, but settled on a 2D sidescrolling platformer. Having recently played *Dear Esther*, I decided to try and make a similar small experience. My wife suggested a game where I was restoring light to world by collecting rays of light, and decided that sounded like a really great idea, and ran with it.

Over the course of the rest of the week, I have worked approximately **20 hours** on the project, bringing the total to about **30 hours** total spent on this project this week.

I spent at least **8 hours** doing a deep dive into Tiled and Phaser's support for it.  I also probably spent more time than strictly necessary on the environment of the game, but I feel like in the end, it looks much better than when I first started.

Finally, one of the features I really enjoy is the effects that go out of the canvas and onto the actual HTML document. Since I was working in JavaScript, I wanted to try to do a couple of interesting things with the page itself. As the player picks up the sunlight, I was initially changing the color of the game world alone. But with some jQuery UI magic, I was able to animate the background color of the page, and then sync the game world background color to the page, and change the entire page color.  I think it creates and interesting effect, and makes the game feel bigger than it's 800x600 resolution.
Finally, at the end, I display a short poem at the end game if the player has collected all the light.
